# World Academy of Politics

Welcome to the World Academy of Politics, an initiative dedicated to providing free, top-quality online education for future leaders. We offer comprehensive guides with world-class courses, empowering learners to pursue an undergraduate-level curriculum at their own pace.

## Curricula

Initially, our offerings cover the following foundational disciplines:

- [**International Relations**](https://github.com/worlddemocrats/academy/blob/main/curricula/INTERNATIONAL_RELATIONS.md): This course provides a deep dive into global politics, international cooperation, and key issues like security and human rights.

- **Law**: Gain a solid foundation in law, covering aspects like constitutional, criminal, contract, and international law, along with insights into legal reasoning and systems.

- **Political Science**: Explore the world of governance, political theory, and processes, and understand the functioning of political systems and their impact on daily life.

More curricula will be added in the future to expand the breadth of our academy.
